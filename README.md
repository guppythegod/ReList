# ReList

This is my implementation on a Todo list app using Vue.js for a frontend framework and flask for a backend framework.

Works like any other productivity app:

- You can create todos
- You can remove todos
- You can append todos

You are also able to attach some metadata to the todos, like:

- Due date
- Project
- Label

There are a couple different "views" to see what you need to do:

1. The "inbox" view: where you see everything
2. The "project" view where you see everything for a specific project
3. The "week" view where you see all todos with a due date within the next 7 days
